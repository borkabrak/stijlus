        The problem with defending the purity of the English language is
        that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just
        borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down
        alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new
        vocabulary.

        The word 'good' has many meanings.  For example, if a man were
        to shoot his grandmother at a range of five hundred yards, I should
        call him a good shot, but not necessarily a good man.

        I like to have a martini,<br />
        Two at the very most.<br />
        After three I'm under the table,<br />
        after four I'm under my host.<br />

        In youth, it was a way I had,<br />
        To do my best to please.<br />
        And change, with every passing lad<br />
        To suit his theories.<br />
        <br />
        But now I know the things I know<br />
        And do the things I do,<br />
        And if you do not like me so,<br />
        To hell, my love, with you.<br />

        A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more
        useful than a life spent doing nothing.

        We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop
        playing.

        It is a curious sensation: the sort of pain that goes mercifully beyond our
        powers of feeling. When your heart is broken, your boats are burned:
        nothing matters any more. It is the end of happiness and the beginning of
        peace.

        The liar's punishment is not in the least that he is not believed, but
        that he cannot believe anyone else.
